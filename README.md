# DisplayManager

This is a simple tool that lets you change the resolution of your screens. You can even use the resolutions/modes hidden by macOS.

A nice feature it has is the one where it automatically sets the screen resolution that you want on startup. This is usefull for Macs with the M1 chip connected to multiple 4K monitors with DisplayLink. 
In this case, macOS will automatically downgrade the resolution to 1080p but DisplayManager will re-enable 4K after the user logins.
